                    <h2><pre>  Salary Account</pre></h2>
                    <P>Salary Accounts are a convenient way of paying the monthly salaries from the employer to the employee. It not only makes it easy for the employer, but also gives ‘Salary Account’ benefits to the employee.</P>
                    <P>By definition, a Salary Account is a type of Savings Account, in which the employer of the account holder deposits a fixed amount of money as ‘salary’ every month.</P>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3><pre>Who can open a Salary Account?</pre></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A business (employer) has to tie-up with a bank to open Salary Accounts for its employees. Every month the amount payable as salaries are transferred in bulk into all respective accounts. If you do not have an account with the bank your employer has a tie-up with, then the employer can assist in opening an account there.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A Salary Account offers more benefits (compared to savings account) as it is more profitable to the bank due to its nature of receiving a fixed amount of money every month. This makes it a fixed source of CASA, which augurs well for the bank’s business.</li>
                            <li>The benefits that a Salary Account holder receives, may vary from bank-to-bank. Within a single bank too, there may be different types of Salary Accounts offering various benefits. However, there are certain common benefits that come with a Salary Account – zero minimum balance, free cheque book / passbook / e-statements, Debit Cards, NetBanking, Phone Banking, online fund transfer, Demat Account/services, loan conveniences, Credit Card offers, utility bill payments, etc.</li>
