                    <h2><pre>  Fixed Deposit</pre></h2>
                    <p>A fixed deposit or FD is an investment instrument that banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFC) offer their customers. Through an FD, people invest a certain sum of money for a fixed period at a predetermined rate of interest in an FD. The rate of interest varies from one financial institution to another, although it is usually higher than the interest offered on savings accounts.</p>
                    <div class="type">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cumulative FDs pay you the interest and the principal at maturity. The interest is reinvested every year. This means that you will not be eligible to receive regular interest payouts, instead of receiving a lump sum at the end of the FD tenure. The cumulative FD option may be suitable for you if you do not need a regular stream of income. Under this option, you will also benefit from the power of compounding, as the following yearâ€™s interest will be calculated on the principal plus interest of the previous year.</li>
                            <li>Non-cumulative FDs will pay you interest at fixed intervals. You could choose to receive interest payments monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annually, depending upon your needs. This will give you a regular stream of income. However, the downside of non-cumulative FDs is that you will lose out on earning interest on interest.</li>
